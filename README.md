# CS-6387-Open-Response-Submission-Template

A template for submitting responses to OR questions assigned on 2VU.

The HTML had to be formatted in an unorthodox manner to overcome the CSS styles applied within the 2VU forum area. So, 
resist from using the values in the template, such as margin-top, in your own projects. The values were ascertained through
testing. Testing was done by submitting comments on a post already rendered in the forum. Try it out for your self. Just 
delete each post between iterations.
